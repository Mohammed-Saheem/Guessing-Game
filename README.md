# 🎯 Guessing Game

Made a Guessing game using Javascript

A simple number guessing game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game runs through browser prompts and logs messages in the console.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. When you open the page in your browser, you're prompted to enter a number — this sets the upper limit for the random number.
2. A random number is then generated between `1` and the number you entered.
3. You are repeatedly prompted to guess the number.
4. The game gives hints if your guess is too small or too big.
5. Type `quit` to exit the game at any time.
6. All messages and feedback are logged to the **browser console**.
